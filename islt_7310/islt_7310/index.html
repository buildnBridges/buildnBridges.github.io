        <p>I would like to share the <em>basics</em> of:</p>
        <p> how to operate excavators and to,</p>
        <p> inspire other to try it out .</p>
        <p>Through explainations, demonstrations and videos you will learn the pattern of ISO controls. Controlling a machine is much like a process, once basic movements are learned a combination of movements can be explored to increase efficiancy
            and productivity. Videos will come from myself and youtube to show examples. Ideally when you get into an excavator with ISO controls you can know how to scoop a bucket of material and dump it in a differant location.</p>
        <p>Basics are not always basic but with a little expalination and demosntration anything can be learned</p>
