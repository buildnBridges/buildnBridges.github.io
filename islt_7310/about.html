            <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I have an <em>array</em> of knowledge running machinery the past <strong>6</strong> years and I <strong>love</strong> it. I would like to share the <em>basics</em> of:</p><p> how to operate excavators and to,</p><p> inspire other to try it out.</p> <br/>I take my job for granted but I have had dozens of people come up to me and say, “wow you have an awesome job” and that makes me feel good. I like being responsible for lives and lots of money and the trust I have in myself operating through both my experience and ability to solve problems.
